Overview
--------

Puppet management of the MIT kerberos stack

This is a SIMP module
---------------------

This module is a component of the `System Integrity Management
Platform <https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP>`__, a
compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our
`JIRA <https://simp-project.atlassian.net/>`__.

Please read our `Contribution
Guide <https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP>`__
and visit our `developer
wiki <https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/SIMP+Development+Home>`__.

This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP
ecosystem, but many of its functions can be used independently.

Setup
-----

What krb5 affects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module helps administrators get a working KDC in place and clients
configured to use the KDC.

The module, by default, sets up a fully functional KDC in your environment and
generates keytabs for one admin user, and all of your hosts that it can
discover via `keydist`.

.. note::
  The `keydist` discovery only works if the KDC is on the same system as your
  Puppet Server!

Setup Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The only thing necessary to begin using krb5 is to install it into
your modulepath.

Beginning with krb5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following sections give a brief guide on how to get started, for more
information, please see the official Red Hat documentation at
https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Managing_Smart_Cards/Configuring_a_Kerberos_5_Server.html

.. note::
  You can skip this section if you're using the default settings. These will
  complete the following for you with randomly generated passwords for all
  keytabs and the master password.

Usage
-----

Automatically manage the KDC and keytabs on clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The examples in this section provides the hiera configuration needed to automatically set up the KDC and keytab distribution.

In your default.yaml hiera file, to be applied to all nodes:

.. code:: yaml

    classes:
      - 'krb5::keytab'

    simp_krb5: true

In your puppet server host yaml file:

.. code:: yaml

  classes:
    - 'krb5::kdc'

With the above configuration, the puppet server will generate an admin user
and principle, and will generate and distribute keytabs unique to each
server to ``/etc/krb5_keytabs/``.


Creating Admin Principals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ACL Configuration
"""""""""""""""""

The following Puppet code snippet will create an ACL for your admin user that
is *probably* appropriate for your organization.

.. code:: ruby

  krb5_acl{ "${::domain}_admin":
   principal       => "*/admin@${::domain}",
   operation_mask  => '*'
  }

Create Your Admin Principal
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Your first principal will be an admin principal and will be allowed to manage
the environment since it is in the `admin` group. This **must** be created on
the KDC system.

Run the following command, as root, to create your principal:

.. code:: bash

  # /usr/sbin/kadmin.local -r YOUR.DOMAIN -q "addprinc <username>/admin"

You can now do everything remotely using this principal. Load it using

.. code:: bash

  $ /usr/bin/kinit <username>/admin

Creating Host Principals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you can really do anything with your hosts, you need to ensure that the
host itself has a keytab.

SIMP uses the `/etc/puppet/keydist` directory for each host to securely
distribute keytabs to the clients.

On the KDC, generate a principal for each host in your environment using the
following command:

.. code:: bash

  # /usr/sbin/kadmin.local -r YOUR.DOMAIN -q 'addprinc -randkey host/<fqdn>'

Create Your Keytabs
"""""""""""""""""""

Then, create a separate keytab file for each of your created hosts using the
following command:

.. code:: bash

  # /usr/sbin/kadmin.local -r YOUR.DOMAIN -q 'ktadd -k <fqdn>.keytab host/<fqdn>'

Propagate the Keytabs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Move all of the resulting keytab files SECURELY to
`<environment_dir>/keydist/<fqdn>/keytabs` on the Puppet server as appropriate
for each file.

.. note::

  Make sure that all of your keytab directories are readable by the group
  **puppet** and not the entire world!

Then, update your node declarations to `include '::krb5::keytab'`.

Once the Puppet Agent runs on the clients, your keytabs will copied to
`/etc/krb5_keytabs`. The keytab matching your `fqdn` will be set in place as
the default system keytab.


Integration with NFS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please see our `NFS module documentation <https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-nfs>`__ or our `online documentation <http://simp.readthedocs.io/en/master/user_guide/HOWTO/NFS.html#exporting-home-directories>`__ on how to integrate NFS with krb5.


Limitations
-----------

SIMP Puppet modules are generally intended to be used on a Redhat
Enterprise Linux-compatible distribution such as EL6 and EL7.

Development
-----------

Please see the `SIMP Contribution Guidelines <https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP>`__.

Acceptance tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the system tests, you need
`Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`__ installed. Then, run:

.. code:: shell

    bundle exec rake acceptance

Some environment variables may be useful:

.. code:: shell

    BEAKER_debug=true
    BEAKER_provision=no
    BEAKER_destroy=no
    BEAKER_use_fixtures_dir_for_modules=yes

-  ``BEAKER_debug``: show the commands being run on the STU and their
   output.
-  ``BEAKER_destroy=no``: prevent the machine destruction after the
   tests finish so you can inspect the state.
-  ``BEAKER_provision=no``: prevent the machine from being recreated.
   This can save a lot of time while you're writing the tests.
-  ``BEAKER_use_fixtures_dir_for_modules=yes``: cause all module
   dependencies to be loaded from the ``spec/fixtures/modules``
   directory, based on the contents of ``.fixtures.yml``. The contents
   of this directory are usually populated by
   ``bundle exec rake spec_prep``. This can be used to run acceptance
   tests to run on isolated networks.
