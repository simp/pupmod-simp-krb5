# **NOTE: THIS IS A [PRIVATE](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib#assert_private) CLASS**
#
# @summary Provides a mechanism for auto-generating keytabs on the KDC as well as provisioning those keytabs for distribution via Puppet if possible.
#
# The keytabs will be collected in a directory that is, by default, located at
# `/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/generated_keytabs`.
#
# The target directory will have subdirectories created, one per
# `host/fqdn@REALM` principal that match the `fqdn` of the host.
#
# Each of those directories will have a krb5.keytab file created that contains
# *all* discovered keytabs for the principal, *regardless of REALM*.
#
# @note If this is enabled on a Puppet server, and `$introspect` is `true`,
#   it will attempt to install the keytabs into the
#   `${environmentpath}/${environment}/site_files/${module_name}_files/files/keytabs`
#   directory.
#
#   It will also attempt to *automatically* create host keytabs for any hosts
#   in one of the following two directories:
#     * `${environmentpath}/${environment}/keydist`
#     * `${environmentpath}/${environment}/site_files/pki_files/files/keydist`
#
#     @note For any of the above, if `$environmentpath` is empty, or does not
#       exist, then `$confdir` will be substituted for
#       `${environmentpath}/${environment}`
#
# @param introspect  If set, attempt to discover, and create all
#   relevant keytabs from data on the Puppet server.
#   @note This has no effect if you aren't running on a Puppet server.
# @param output_dir  The directory into which to install the
#   keytabs.
# @param all_known  If set, generate keytabs for any 'host/.*' entries
#   known to the KDC.
# @param user  The user that should own the keytab files.
# @param group  The group that should own the keytab files.
# @param realms  The REALMs into which the hosts should be added unless
#   otherwise specified in the `$hosts` Hash. Will be auto-upcased.
# @param global_services  An Array of Kerberos services that
#   should be added to *all* hosts.
# @param hosts  A Hash of hosts for which keytabs should be
#   generated, and kept in the KDC by Puppet.
#   This is done as a Hash so that you don't end up with thousands of Puppet
#   resources in your catalog.
#   @note The Hash should be formatted as follows:
#     {
#       'fqdn' =>
#         'ensure'   => ('absent'|'present') # Required
#         'realms'   => ['REALM1', 'REALM2'] # Optional. Will be auto upcased.
#         'services' => ['svc1','svc2']      # Optional
#     }
#
#   @note This will be combined with the auto-generated hosts if $auto_generate
#     is `true`
# @param purge  If set, purge any keytab directories for systems that
#   we don't know about.
